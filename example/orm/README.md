ORM test
==========================

The proposed way to test out these ORM implementations are to copy them all to your `me/orm-test/` directory and use them from there.

```
# Go to the root of the course repo
rsync -av example/orm/ me/orm-test/
cd me/orm-test
```

Each directory contains the instructions on how to get going with each ORM.
