# Unit Testing
## According to my experience
### Marie Grahn

# Agenda

* Me
* Why do testing?
* Different ways of working with unit testing
* Test driven development

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Me

* 30 years of work experience
* First job as C++ designer - no tests!?
* 20 years at Ericsson, different roles
* Last 10 as Java designer (design and unit test).
* Career change to web programming and teaching at BTH.

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Ericsson

* 100 000 employees (13 000 in Sweden).
* 400 student summer interns each summer and 200 students write their masterâ€™s
thesis with Ericsson each year.
* Mostly mobile communication, like 5G, the fifth generation of cellular networks.
* Me: Ericsson Dynamic Activation (EDA), a provisioning platform for automated activation
of telecommunications services. e.g. IMSI change over.

# Why do testing?

* To secure that the code works according to requirements.
* Used as quality assurance to prove that the task/project is done.
* Used both in new software, software updates, and refactoring.

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Task/project

* Do these requirements within this time frame.
* Unit testing proves the requirements.
* Present the result to product owner/project manager.

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Unit testing in different ways

1. Designers code & testers unit tests
2. Designers - unit tests afterwards
3. Designers - unit tests during development/coding
4. Designers, dived into designers & testers
5. Test driven development (TDD), unit tests first & coding afterwards

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Prototyping

* Between programming and unit testing.
* Create a class and do some code lines to get started.
* For example...

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Unit testing

* Testing a class or part of the class.
* Mocking database calls etc.
* Both positive and negative cases.
* Large code base => many test classes

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Basics

* Unit test often.
* Validate code often.
* A lot of small commits (push, tags).
* Use the required code standard and naming convention.

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 1. Designers code & testers unit tests

* Testers start with unit tests in advance.
* Designers starts coding and verifies the codes often with the unit test.
* Advantages: high code quality, excellent unit tests
* Disadvantage: cost

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 2. Designers - unit tests afterwards

* White box testing
* Unit tests are ok but not that as good as made by testers.
* Unit tests are more to please management or some standard than improve code quality.
* When testing is not prioritized.

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 3. Designers - unit tests during coding

* White box testing
* Unit tests are good but not that in class with testers.
* Work: write a code part, doing some unit tests and run them => ev updating code
or test => start over
* Good unit tests, fast to write tests but influenced by own code

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 4. Designers, dived into designers & testers

* Designer team discuss the task, requirements, and solution.
* Designer team divided into designer and testers. Change roles next task.
* Test group writing unit test from requirements and solution discussion.
* Designer group programming according to requirements and solution discussion.
* Good/very good unit tests

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Advantages with different designers and testers

* Clear interface
* Requirements are discussed and more understood
* Testers - excellent & thorough unit tests
* Designers - clean, efficient, and easy to read code doing the right things

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 5. TDD, unit tests first & coding afterwards

* Designer team discuss the task, requirements, and solution.
* Start writing unit test from requirements and solution discussion.
* Then programming according to requirements and solution discussion.
* Good/very good unit tests

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 5. TDD, an example

* Requirements
* Solution discussion and interface
* Unit tests
* Coding

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 5. TDD, Dice game, requirements

* A dealer and a player, closest to 21 wins.
* Player starts.
* 3 dices, rolls, add the sum, and stop.

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 5. TDD, Solution discussion

* Interface
* Classes
* Test classes

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 5. TDD, Classes/Test classes

* Game21Interface/Game21InterfaceTest
* Game21/Game21Test
* Player/PlayerTest
* Dice/DiceTest

</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 5. Test driven development, Game 21

The code and the unit tests are in the example folder in example/phpunit together
with the Guess example from kmom04 exercise.
Source code in src/Game21 and unit tests in test/Game21


</script>


<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Summary

* Unit testing is improving the code quality.
* Quality insurance when updating/changing the code.
