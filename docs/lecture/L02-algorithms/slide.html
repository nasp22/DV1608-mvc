# How to solve problems?

* Take a walk in the park
* Sleep on it

* (both means to breath slowly and allow the brain to slow down and get some basic structure of the problem at hand)

* How can we help the brain to structure the problems?

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Small problems are easy?

* Large and unclear problems are real hard to deal with
* Organise and divide all large problems into small problems
* Smaller problems are easier to deal with
* When they are small enough they could even disappear since they were not really a prioritized problem...

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Understand the problem

* We need to understand the basics of the problem
* We need to put the problem into context
* We need to deal with semantics of the problem
* Are we solving the right problem?
* Are we solving the problem right?

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Define the problem

* Is the problem well-defined?
* Is the problem ill-defined?
* How good are the requirement specification?
* How good is the writer of the requirement specification?

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Well-defined problem

* Specific end goals
* Clearly expected solutions
* Easy to read, grasp and understand
* Ill-defined problems might lack these features

<p class="footnote">Well-defined problems allow for more initial planning than ill-defined problems.</p>

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Ill-defined problem

* Is it really a problem?
* Ask "why five times"
* What is the root problem of this problem?
* Find the root cause

<p class="footnote">Problem solving to find the underlying issue https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys.</p>

<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Five whys

The vehicle will not start.

1. Why? – The battery is dead. (First why)
2. Why? – The alternator is not functioning. (Second why)
3. Why? – The alternator belt has broken. (Third why)
4. Why? – The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (Fourth why)
5. Why? – The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause)

<p class="footnote">Solve the right problem.</p>

<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Problem solving (linguistic)

* Pragmatics - how context contributes to meaning
* Semantics - how intepretation of the problem contributes to meaning

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Problem solving (areas)

* Psychology - finding solutions to problems encountered in life
* Cognitive sciences - research on how people do problem solving
* Logic - formally prove solutions to problems
* Engineering - products or processes, invent and prevent failure
* Military science - what is the end state?

# Polya

> Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques

1. Polya’s First Principle: Understand the problem
1. Polya’s Second Principle: Devise a plan
1. Polya’s Third Principle: Carry out the plan
1. Polya’s Fourth Principle: Look back

<p class="footnote">From a book released 1945 "How To Solve". Read more on https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf.</p>

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Polya - 1:<br>Understand the problem

* Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
* What are you asked to find or show?
* Can you restate the problem in your own words?
* Can you think of a picture or diagram that might help you understand the
problem?
* Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Polya - 2: Device a plan

> Many ways to solve a problem.

• Guess and check • Look for a pattern
• Make an orderly list • Draw a picture
• Eliminate possibilities • Solve a simpler problem
• Use symmetry • Use a model
• Consider special cases • Work backwards
• Use direct reasoning • Use a formula
• Solve an equation • Be ingenious

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Polya - 3: Carry out the plan

* Easier to do then to create the plan
* Follow through with care and patience, if you have the necessary skills
* Persist with the plan you have
* Discard it when it fails and pick another plan
* Do not be mislead and keep your focus

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Polya - 4: Look back

* Reflect and look back at what you have done
* What worked, and what didn’t
* Predict what strategy to use to solve future problems

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Tip on Polya

* Make a document
* Write down the headlines
    1. Understand the problem
    1. Device a plan
    1. Carry out the plan
    1. Look back
* Fill the headlines with text, while working on the problem

<p class="footnote">Writing stuff down is always a good thing.</p>

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Look back

* Think about some problems you did solve lately
* Did it turn out well or not?
* What were the issues that worked well or not?
* Bring this with you onto the next problem solving task

# Problem solving
## Philosophies
</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Philosophies

* YAGNI (You aint gonna need it)
* KISS (Keep it simple stupid)
* Dont overdo it / overengineering
* Pareto principle 80/20 (80% of the users uses 20% of the features)
* Bikeshedding (easy problems gets disproportionate attention)

# Problem solving
## Tools and methods
</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Tools and methods

* Top down
* Bottom up
* Pseudo code
* Flowchart

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Top down

* Stepwise design and refinement or decomposition
* Break down a system to gain insight into its sub-systems
* Formulate an overview of the system
* Specify (no detail) the first-level sub-systems
* Each sub-system is the refined in greater detail
* Continue until all elements/sub-systems are defined in detail

<p class="footnote">Read more on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design.</p>

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Top down...

> Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Bottom up

* Piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems
* Make the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system
* Individual base elements are first specified in great detail
* These are then linked together to form larger subsystems
* A "seed" model
* Initially small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness

<p class="footnote">Read more on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design.</p>

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Bottom up...

> Bottom up starts with the pieces and makeing each piece work, before combining them into a larger and complete system.

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Top down vs bottom up

* Top-down approaches emphasize planning and a complete understanding of the system
* No coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design
* Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing
* Begin as soon as the first module has been specified

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Top down vs bottom up...

> Modern software design approaches usually combine both top-down and bottom-up approaches

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Pseudo code

* Write normal language to express the code to be written
* Plan your code on a high level
* Explain or design a complex algorithm
* Sketch on a skeleton programming or dummy code
* No broad standard for pseudo code syntax exists

# Pseudo code constructs

* SEQUENCE is a linear progression where one task is performed sequentially after another.
* WHILE is a loop (repetition) with a simple conditional test at its beginning.
* IF-THEN-ELSE is a decision (selection) in which a choice is made between two alternative courses of action.
